<h3 align="center">Data Analyst specializing in operational analytics, KPI systems, and scalable reporting</h3>

---

## 👋 Overview

I work in analytics where engineering systems, operational workflows, and business strategy intersect.

My approach focuses on transforming complex datasets into structured decision frameworks rather than producing one-off reports. I specialize in building analytics environments that improve visibility, reduce ambiguity, and support measurable performance improvement.

Core strengths include translating operational data into actionable insights, defining meaningful performance metrics, and designing reporting solutions that scale with organizational needs.
